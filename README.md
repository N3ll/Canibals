Exercise descrition

Cannibals eat captured missionaries in the following order:
First the missionaries is forced to stand in a circle.
Then the first to be eaten is selected randomly and removed from the circle. 
The next to be eaten (and removed from the circle) is selected by counting to 5 starting with the missionary standing after the last removed missionary. And so forth.

Create a program that simulates the eating of missionaries using circularly single-linked nodes.

More formally:
- create a Person class (with a name field). - create a Circle class with methods
- addPerson(Person p) – add a person to the circle
- printPersons() – print all persons in the circle
- removeFirst() – remove and return the first person (randomly selected)
- removeNext(int count) – remove and return the next person (selected by count).
- test your methods from the Circle class i a test class.
